# Automatic Weekly Update Generator â€“ Frontend

This is the frontend for the **Automatic Weekly Update Generator**: a professional, full-stack application that helps users log daily work, receive reminders, and generate weekly summaries using Google Gemini LLM. The frontend is built with React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and integrates with Supabase for authentication and backend API calls.

- **Daily Entry Logging** (create, view, edit)
- **Weekly Report Generation** (with Gemini LLM)
- **View/Edit All Entries**
- **View All Weekly Reports** (filterable, resizable tables)
- **User Settings** (timezone, reminders, PDF/email options)
- **Responsive UI** (Tailwind CSS)
- **Professional UX** (modals, spinners, copy-to-clipboard, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- npm or yarn
- Supabase project (for auth and database)
- Backend API (FastAPI, running separately)

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000  # or your FastAPI backend URL
   ```

## Customization

- **Styling:**  
  Tailwind CSS is used for rapid, responsive UI development. Customize styles in `tailwind.config.js` or component classes.

- **API Integration:**  
  All API calls are made to the FastAPI backend. Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` as needed.

- **Authentication:**  
  Supabase JS SDK handles magic link login and session management.

## Deployment
